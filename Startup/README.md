## PHP Reverse Shell


ftp directory have full permissions enabled which allowed me to transfer from my machine to the ftp server a php reverse shell file and execute it while having netcat listener in the background.

Found answer to the first question:
```
$ cat recipe.txt
Someone asked what our main ingredient to our spice soup is today. I figured I can't keep it a secret forever and told him it was love.
```

- Found a directory named "incidents" containing a .pcapng file, which stores captured network traffic (e.g., from Wireshark or tcpdump).
- Since the file wasnâ€™t readable on the target machine, I transferred it to my local machine by running ``` python3 -m http.server 8000 ``` on the target and ``` wget http://10.10.215.35:8000/suspicious.pcapng ``` on my machine.
- Used ``` strings suspicious.pcapng ``` to read the file and found repeated connection attempts using the password: c4ntg3t3n0ughsp1c3.
