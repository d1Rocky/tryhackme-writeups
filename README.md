# tryhackme-solved

Welcome to my collection of documented TryHackMe rooms that I've completed as part of my ongoing cybersecurity learning journey. Each write-up showcases the steps I took to enumerate, exploit, and ultimately "clear" various challenges on the TryHackMe platform.

This repository serves as both a learning log and a demonstration of my hands-on experience in areas such as:

Vulnerability scanning

Privilege escalation

Web application security

Linux and Windows exploitation

Networking and enumeration

CTF-style problem solving

I update this repo regularly as I complete new rooms. For ethical reasons, flags and answers are not shared, but the techniques, tools, and methodologies are documented to reflect my learning process.
